    "- Adjusting Minimum Probability: By default, objects detected with a probability percentage of less than 50 will not be shown or reported. You can increase this value for high certainty cases or reduce the value for cases where all possible objects are needed to be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Objects Detection: Using a provided CustomObject class, you can tell the detection class to report detections on one or a few number of unique objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection Speeds: You can reduce the time it takes to detect an image by setting the speed of detection speed to “fast”, “faster” and “fastest”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Types: You can specify and parse in file path to an image, Numpy array or file stream of an image as the input image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output Types: You can specify that the detectObjectsFromImage function should return the image in the form of a file or Numpy array\n",
