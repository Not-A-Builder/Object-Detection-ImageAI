    "ImageAI supports many powerful customization of the object detection process. One of it is the ability to extract the image of each object detected in the image. By simply parsing the extra parameter extract_detected_objects=True into the detectObjectsFromImage function as seen below, the object detection class will create a folder for the image objects, extract each image, save each to the new folder created and return an extra array that contains the path to each of the images."

    "### Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "ImageAI provides many more features useful for customization and production capable deployments for object detection tasks. Some of the features supported are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adjusting Minimum Probability: By default, objects detected with a probability percentage of less than 50 will not be shown or reported. You can increase this value for high certainty cases or reduce the value for cases where all possible objects are needed to be detected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Custom Objects Detection: Using a provided CustomObject class, you can tell the detection class to report detections on one or a few number of unique objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detection Speeds: You can reduce the time it takes to detect an image by setting the speed of detection speed to “fast”, “faster” and “fastest”.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input Types: You can specify and parse in file path to an image, Numpy array or file stream of an image as the input image\n",
    "\n",
    "- Output Types: You can specify that the detectObjectsFromImage function should return the image in the form of a file or Numpy array\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find all the details and documentation of how to make use of the above features, as well as other computer vision features contained in ImageAI on the official GitHub repository.\n",
